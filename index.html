            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a current graduate student at UCSD pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. 
            With a previous background in healthcare, I obtained my BS in Pharmacological Chemistry at UCSD in 2022. 
            After completing a year of pharmacy school, a period of introspection compelled me to pursue my true passion in programming and software development. 
            I applied back to UCSD to the MS program and after a year of self-preparation, I began my computer science journey fall of 2023. My goals now are to contiously develop my skills
            at UCSD while also looking for any opportunity to apply the technical skills I'm learning. I've been having a great time delving into the world of computer science and I'm excited for 
            the possibilities that may come in the future!</p>

            <p>When I'm not developing my skills, my hobbies include piano, video games, rock climbing, and weightlifting. I was born and raised in San Diego
                but am always looking for opportunities to travel and explore new places. I really enjoy trying new foods, so I'm always looking for new places to try and visit with friends and family!

                <h3>Service Industry TipBot</h3>
                <p> During my undergrad career, I worked at a local restaurant in La Jolla called Din Tai Fung. It was something I really enjoyed and when I started my computer science journey, I thought
                    making a tip calculator would be a fun project to work on. I wanted to make something that would be useful for my coworkers and I, so I decided to make a tip calculator where
                    servers could log their daily tips and sales, and see how much they made that day. Addiionally, you would be filter your shifts by day or shift type to see how your averages change per shift.
                    I used Javascript, React, and CSS to build the frontend and am currently stil in the process of adding a backend to store user data.
