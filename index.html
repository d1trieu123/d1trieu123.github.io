            <p class = "text">I'm a current graduate student at UCSD pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. 
            With a previous background in healthcare, I obtained my BS in Pharmacological Chemistry at UCSD in 2022. After taking a gap year, I decided to change career paths and apply for my 
            MS in computer science, and began my graduate career in the fall of 2023. Since then, I have learned so much about the field of computer science, and have broadened my skills as a developer
            through my various graduate courses. My goals now are tyo contiously develop my skills and learn as much as I can so that when I entire the field as a developer, I can make an impact and contribute in the best way possible. <br>
            <br>
            In my free time, my hobbies include piano, video games, rock climbing, and weightlifting. I was born and raised in San Diego
                but am always looking for opportunities to travel and explore new places. I really enjoy trying new foods, so I'm always looking for new places to try and visit with friends and family. On this website
                you will see the coursework I've done as well as the various projects I've worked on in my time at UCSD. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to connect!
