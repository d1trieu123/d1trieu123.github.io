            <p class = "text">I'm a current graduate student at UCSD pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. 
            With a previous background in healthcare, I obtained my BS in Pharmacological Chemistry at UCSD in 2022. 
            After completing a year of pharmacy school, a period of introspection compelled me to pursue my true passion in programming and software development. 
            I applied back to UCSD to the MS program and after a year of self-preparation, I began my computer science journey fall of 2023. My goals now are to contiously develop my skills
            at UCSD while also looking for any opportunity to apply the technical skills I'm learning. I've been having a great time delving into the world of computer science and I'm excited for 
            the possibilities that may come in the future! <br>
            <br>
            In my free time, my hobbies include piano, video games, rock climbing, and weightlifting. I was born and raised in San Diego
                but am always looking for opportunities to travel and explore new places. I really enjoy trying new foods, so I'm always looking for new places to try and visit with friends and family!
